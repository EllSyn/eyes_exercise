# Eyes exercise

## Description

In this exercise the objective was to create a web app that has two eyes that follows the cursor's movement across the screen. The web app is written in HTML, JS and CSS. The JS file is responsible for updating the CSS properties of the eyeballs so that they follow the movement of the cursor

## How to run

Clone the project to your own computer. Then simply open the index.html file in a browser window. The eyes will follow the cursor once you start moving it

## Roadmap of future improvements

In the future I maybe try to make a person or a figure to put the eyes on
